# Quad-Draw
An optimised drawing solution using Quadtrees Data structure.
This is the final project for the DSA course, where our main aim was to implement a Data Structure that was not included in the course content. This project uses Quadtrees to spatially divide the space and efficiently use it to provide a smoother drawing experience. Users can choose to visualize the Quadtree divisions using the Toggle Quadtree button and their reversal whenever the eraser is used.
